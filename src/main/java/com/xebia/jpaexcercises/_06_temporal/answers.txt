The @Temporal annotation is used to insert data in date format in the DB.
TemporalType.DATE saves the date in default YYYY-MM-DD format
whereas
TemporalType.TIMESTAMP saves the date as timestamp of that time in default format
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS. But, we can change the format of the date as per our convinence.
