Using Ordinal as EnumType, employeeType will be set as the attribute position starting from 0 defined in the EmployeeType enum
and will be stored in DB as int(11).
FULL_TIME                 ->  0 (these are the positions )
PART_TIME                 ->  1
CONTRACTOR                ->  2
Whereas
Using EnumType as STRING, the employeeType will be string and stored as {VARCHAR(255)} in the DB.
