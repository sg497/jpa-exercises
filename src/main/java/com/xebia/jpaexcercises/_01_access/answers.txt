1) In EmployeeWithFieldAccess, @Id annotation is given on field. The default is FieldAccess so there is no need to specify the
  AccessType.FieldType.
2) In EmployeeWithMixedAccess, @Id annotation is given on field. As the AccessType.FieldType is at Entity level and the
   AccessType.PropertyType is on the method getEmailAddress, so a new column with name email_address will be created in DB.
3) In EmployeeWithPropertyAccess, @Id annotation is given on property as the AccessType.PropertyType is at Entity level.

The resulting table structure remains same.
