1. How many tables are created when you run `ElementCollectionApp.java`? What is the structure of generated tables?
2. What will happen if Employee can have only one item? i.e. rather than List<Item> we have Item.
3. How can you ensure tables created for Item and NickNames are named `items` and `nick_names`?
4. How can you ensure tables created for Item and NickNames have primary key with name `emp_id` instead of `Employee_id`?
5. Are items and nickNames fetched lazily?
