1) We can make this example run without any exception by adding argument
   cascade=CascadeType.PERSIST to @OneToOne mapping defined.
2) Number of tables created- 3.
   Table with the foreign key employees table.
3) We can rename foreign key, by using @JoinColumn(name="plot_id") we can rename the foreign key
4) we make a reference variable of Employee with @OneToOne mapping mappedBy="parkingSpace".
5) As mapping is bidirectional, if we fetch parking employee is also fetched.
   Logs:
   Employee{id=1, name='Employee1', salary=1000000, parkingSpace=ParkingSpace{id=2, lotNo=1234}}
